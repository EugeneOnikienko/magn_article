\section{Intro}

This paper is aimed to study magnetic dynamics of the synthetic antiferromagnets under the influence of spin-polarized current and external magnetic field.

The first step in this direction is to consider the system in details:
\begin{itemize}
\item to give a definition of the synthetic antiferromagnetic system and to describe the main components of it;
\item to describe assumptions about intrinsic structure of the components;
\end{itemize}

The second step is to consider the linear approximation of the dynamic equations. Here we expect to get the analytical expression of the critical current and the eigenfrequencies of the system.

At the next step we expect to write dynamic equations in the convenient form to use it in numerical experiment. During the numerical experiment  we expect to confirm our analytical results.
